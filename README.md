Code Sample
===========

This sample allows an XML file containing "server information" to be uploaded to a mySQL database through a command line prompt, using a limited set of command line options, provided by the app.

1) There's a sample of a database script to be used in the "cfg" folder.

2) There's a sample of a XML file to be used in the "cfg" folder.

3) There's a JAR executable to test the compiled code in the "bin" folder (just run it with "java -jar SampleApp.jar" in a command line).

4) All the code is profusely commented, for easier understanding

5) Help/troubleshooting is included within the app (when executing it)

6) There was an additional script to give proper permissions for the JDBC to be executed correctly, but it's missing
